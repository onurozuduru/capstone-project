# Capstone Project

This is my capstone project report from 2015. I did not edit the content of the report,
I only removed my personal information such as student ID, address and mobile phone number
and added watermark for license. Therefore, I hope you would be fair and consider that
it is my first academic paper, while you are reading it.

As I mentioned before I only changed the Curriculum Vitae page (page number 26) to keep
my private information out of the Internet and I removed my student ID from the first page of the report.

There are also results on CSV format for different distance methods and source code
of the voting_mrmr function with a demo dataset. I uploaded only the most important
function as source code, please read its README file before running the code.

Also my 3-5 minutes presentation is available on [this page](http://prezi.com/eyr7fbtd8iqe/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share). However there is no
transcript for presentation.

If you use all or any part of the report file, please put my name and a link to this github page
on your paper as attribution.

There is my contact information below, so if you want to say anything about this
project report or this Github repo, please reach me.
